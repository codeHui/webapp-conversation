# Conversation Web App Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The app now uses a local JWT-authenticated backend proxy for Dify. The browser only talks to the Next.js API routes, and agent API keys stay on the server.

## Config App

Create a file named `.env.local` in the current directory and copy the contents from `.env.example`. Setting the following content:

```
# APP URL: This is the API's base URL. If you're using the Dify cloud service, set it to: https://api.dify.ai/v1.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=

# Multi-agent configuration. Each item needs a display name, appId, and apiKey.
# The appId is the unique identifier from the Dify app URL.
# The apiKey is generated from the app's API Access page.
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_CONFIGS=[{"name":"Agent 1","appId":"your-first-app-id","apiKey":"app-your-first-key"},{"name":"Agent 2","appId":"your-second-app-id","apiKey":"app-your-second-key"}]

# Optional but recommended in production. Used to sign the local JWT auth cookie.
JWT_SECRET=replace-this-in-production
```

Single-agent mode is still supported as a fallback:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.dify.ai/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID=your-app-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_KEY=app-your-app-key
```

When multiple agents are configured, the app renders a collapsible panel on the far left so users can switch between agents. Conversation continuity remains scoped by Dify app ID, and the visible agent list is filtered by RBAC.

## RBAC

Edit [rbac.json](./rbac.json) directly to manage roles and accounts. The backend reloads this file at request time.

```json
{
  "defaultPassword": "123456",
  "roles": {
    "admin": {
      "agents": ["agent-1", "agent-2"]
    },
    "user": {
      "agents": ["agent-1"]
    }
  },
  "users": [
    { "username": "admin", "role": "admin" },
    { "username": "user", "role": "user" }
  ]
}
```

Notes:

- `defaultPassword` is the shared password for every configured account.
- `roles.<role>.agents` can reference an agent by generated ID, agent name, or Dify `appId`.
- If you do not provide an explicit `id` in `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_CONFIGS`, agent IDs are generated from the agent name. For the default example above, `Agent 1 -> agent-1` and `Agent 2 -> agent-2`.
- The default accounts are `admin / 123456` and `user / 123456`.
- The backend also accepts `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` headers, but the built-in login flow stores the JWT in an HTTP-only cookie.

Config more in `config/index.ts` file:

```js
export const APP_INFO: AppInfo = {
  title: 'Chat APP',
  description: '',
  copyright: '',
  privacy_policy: '',
  default_language: 'zh-Hans'
}

export const isShowPrompt = true
export const promptTemplate = ''
```

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Using Docker

```
docker build . -t <DOCKER_HUB_REPO>/webapp-conversation:latest
# now you can access it in port 3000
docker run -p 3000:3000 <DOCKER_HUB_REPO>/webapp-conversation:latest
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
